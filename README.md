windawesome_config
==================

My windawesome configurations which try to capture the goodness of [i3 WM][i3].

## About Windawesome

[Windawesome][windawesome] is a tiling windows manager for Windows.
To install it, don't forget to also download the `Required DLL v3` package available
in the download section of the site.

## About these configurations

These configurations try to replicate my i3 configuration for UI and shortcuts.
The color theme is inspired by the [Solarized Dark theme][solarized].

## Detailed configuration of the whole Windows box

- Windawesome[windawesome] of course ;-)
- [Find and Run Robot][FARR] for the application launcher (replace dmenu on the linux box).
- [Cygwin][cygwin] using mintty along with zsh (oh-my-zsh config) and ranger.
- [Proto][proto] as an alternative to ranger and explorer.
